        <p id="note-text">If there’s one thing I’ve learned about “ugly boys,” it’s that they’re rarely told they’re
            handsome by
            someone who isn’t a blood relative. Before, I used to think no one could ever love me.
            <br>
            <br>
            Ever since middle school, I’ve been insecure about my looks and about how people perceived me. Recently,
            though, I had an important enlightenment: we are often our own worst enemies. The harshest judgments don’t
            come from others, they come from within ourselves.
            <br>
            <br>
            So many people believe they’re uglier than they truly are, when in reality they’re not ugly at all. It’s the
            actions people do that determine true ugliness.
            <br>
            <br>
            I remember throughout most of middle school, even in 80 degree weather I would wear hoodies just to hide my
            body. I thought that maybe I could cover it up and the pain it brought would just disappear. Looking back on
            this period of my life, I cringe so hard.
            <br>
            <br>
            Meeting you has begun to fill my pessimistic half empty cup to full. I began to have a more optimistic
            outlook on myself because of you. I'm still learning to truly love myself, so I hope you can forgive me and
            understand as I
            am likely to be reluctant to take photos. But I will make an effort, for you and for myself.
            <br>
            <br>
            So thank you, Jalaina, for putting me on the path toward self love. One day I hope to love myself as much as
            I love you.
